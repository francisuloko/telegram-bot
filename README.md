# telegram-bot

> Microverse ruby capstone project to build a bot

This is a solo project to build a bot by putting into practice
the concepts of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) learned in Ruby Module. I have demonstrated the use of classes (and Module) in Ruby and how to access their properties and methods. Here is a brief description of my bot.

Paddy (@PaddyMyBot) is a bot built using telegram bot API. It has the ability to scrape news
channels and display the latest news headlines in the user's chat. The idea behind this project is to enable fast paced individuals to be on the know by looking at news headlines.

3. Read Description and click `Start`
4. Enter `/` to select news source
